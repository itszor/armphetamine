<h1><a name="overview">Overview</a></h1>

<p>ARMphetamine is a project to create a fast and accurate ARM processor emulator. A technique known as "dynamic recompilation" will be used so that the highest possible speed can be achieved for emulated code - ARM code programs are translated into native code as they are being emulated. The current development platform is Linux/x86.

<p>The code is currently being rewritten to aid support of the features which had to be left out of the original code due to time constraints. When it's back in shape, I promise it'll be better than ever before.

<p>ARMphetamine supports, or will support:

<ul>
<li>26-bit/32-bit (ARM610/710/SA110) code emulation (fairly complete)
<li>Thumb mode (incomplete, untested)
<li>Full memory-management unit (MMU) with domain access control, etc. (not extensively tested)
<li>ARM7500/Risc PC-style physical memory map. Will later be configurable to suit different types of system.
<li>ARM7500/Risc PC support hardware: VIDC20, IOMD (sketchy)
<li>Dynamic binary translation (experimental)
<ul>
<li>IA-32 target architecture
<li>Full cross-block register allocation, currently based on the linear scan algorithm (mostly working!)
<li>Direct binary-code generation (partly working!)
<li>Peephole optimiser (possibility)
<li>More targets (possibility)
</ul>
<li>Built-in debugger
<li>Bells, whistles, etc.
</ul>

<p>There is currently no projected release date. It would be a foolish thing to try to guess. If you'd be interested in building an emulator around ARMphetamine or incorporating it in an existing project, feel free to get in touch.

<h3>22 November 2002</h3>

<p>There's very much internal reorganisation of the ARMphetamine sources, so that now all the parts of it are separated into nice logical units. There are multiple makefiles for the different "personalities" that the emulator is capable of assuming (LART emulation, Riscose backend, etc.). There are even some basic instructions, in the README file.

<h3>21 September 2002</h3>

<p>You might have noticed there hasn't been much news about ARMphetamine
recently. I've been busy doing other things. In the small amount of time
I've dedicated to the project, the focus has been attempting to boot
a Linux kernel - this means quite a lot of fiddly code needs to be
written and bugfixed. If I get it going, this will be the place I
report it. If you have in-depth knowledge of ARM Linux or the
SA-1100 chip, maybe you'd be interested in grabbing the code
from CVS and hacking it a bit, I'd be grateful for help (in
the form of patches, preferably). I'm using blob, kernels and ramdisk
from the <a href="http://www.lart.tudelft.nl">LART</a> project.

<p>The furthest it's got so far is (failing) to mount a root
filesystem under interpretive emulation. To try it, obtain the right
versions of blob, a kernel and ramdisk image from the LART page, name them
appropriately and type "make lartrun" in a suitable environment. Enjoy!

<h1><a name="status">Status</a></h1>

<p>Some preliminary (old!) comparative benchmarks are available:

<p><table align=center>
<tr>
<td><b>Processor [recomp]</b></td>
<td><b>Compiler/OS</b></td>
<td><b>Platform</b></td>
<td><b>Dhrystones/sec</b></td>
</tr>
 
<tr>
<td>ARMphetamine [off]</td>
<td>GCC/NetBSD</td>
<td>Linux/x86</td>
<td>5527</td>
</tr>
 
<tr>
<td>12MHz ARM250</td>
<td>Norcroft/RISC OS</td>
<td>RISC OS/arm26</td>
<td>6169</td>
</tr>
 
<tr>
<td>ARMphetamine [on]</td>
<td>GCC/NetBSD</td>
<td>Linux/x86</td>
<td>34843</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>233MHz StrongARM</td>
<td>GCC/NetBSD</td>
<td>NetBSD/arm32</td>
<td>275482</td>
</tr>
 
<tr>
<td>450MHz AMD K6-2</td>
<td>GCC/Linux</td>
<td>Linux/x86</td>
<td>823045</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks were obtained using the standard (if aging) "Dhrystone" program (higher numbers are better). As you may infer, the emulator currently runs somewhere around the speed of an ARM610 on my development machine. Performance increases are expected.

<h1><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h1>

<p>There are two main documents describing ARMphetamine. The first is older and
more likely to be out-of-date, the second is the dissertation I wrote as part
of the university project ARMphetamine was written for.

<h1><a name="download">Download</a></h1>

<p>The preferred way of getting hold of ARMphetamine now is by anonymous CVS from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>. Follow <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=18506">this link</a> for instructions. The <i>modulename</i> is "armphetamine".

<p>You can download a tarball of the ARMphetamine source code here, but it might not be the absolute latest version.

<p>Download <a href="bin/armphetamine-0.2.tar.gz">armphetamine-0.2.tar.gz</a>.

<p>Enjoy...
