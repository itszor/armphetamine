<center><h1>A neat hack for speeding up arbitrary flow control in dynamically-recompiled code</h1></center>
<p align=center>Julian Brown, 2 March 2001.

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In the model the original <a href="http://www.dynarec.com/~jules"><i>ARMphetamine</i></a> used to run foreign code on a particular platform, a two-tier system was used for emulation. At the core of the system was an interpretive core which took ARM instructions one at a time, decoded them and executed them in software (a relatively slow process). As this traditional emulation was done, the code being executed was profiled and commonly-executed chunks of code were translated into native code to be run in place of the equivalent ARM code block in the future, leading to greatly enhanced performance.

<p>Due to the way the profiling algorithm worked, only a small portion of the whole emulated program was available for analysis during any given invocation of the recompilation algorithm. Often on exit from a particular chunk of code, no further recompiled code is readily available for execution, so the system must fall back to the interpretive emulator and continue emulation in that way.

<p>In more detail, during a recompiled code block, four different classes of flow control were identified:

<ol>
<li>Fixed (constant destination) jump within the current recompiled chunk
<li>Fixed jump outside the current recompiled chunk, to the beginning of a previously-recompiled chunk. (Execution may not commence from the middle of a previously-recompiled chunk due to register/flag allocation issues.)
<li>Fixed jump outside the current recompiled chunk, to a currently-unknown location
<li>Calculated jump (ie, switch statement)
</ol>

<p>The first case is no problem, and can be dealt with easily and efficiently in the translated code.

<p>The second case is also no problem, as control can be passed directly, in the translated machine code, to the previous chunk of translated machine code.

<p>The fourth case is the target of the technique I propose here. Although the third case could perhaps trigger a further (recursive?) invocation of the recompiler from the target address, I'll treat it as a special case of the fourth case for now.

<h3>The Hack</h3>

<p>Consider the situations in which a 'calculated' jump can occur:

<ol>
<li>Probably the most common is returning from a subroutine, such as:
<pre>
<i>add</i>:
        <em>add</em> r0,r0,r1
        <em>movs</em> pc,r14
</pre>
<li>Switch statements:
<pre>
        <em>adds</em> pc,pc,r0,lsl #2
        <em>mov</em> r0,r0
        <em>b</em> zero_case
        <em>b</em> one_case
        <em>b</em> two_case
        <em>b</em> three_case
        ...
</pre>
<li>Method call, eg (something like):
<pre>
        <em>ldr</em> pc,[r5,lsl #2]
</pre>
<li>(any others?)
</ol>

<p>The easy (but inefficient) way of translating each of these cases to native code is simple - don't. This is the current solution used in ARMphetamine: when the program counter is set to an arbitrary address, just drop back to the interpretive emulator. This isn't quite so bad as it might be - due to the way the profiling system works, it's possible that the emulator will do a hash table lookup on the new program counter address before any code has been (slowly) emulated, and discover that a block of translated code does indeed exist for that address. Unfortunately this involves dropping back into C code and doing a slow (at the level of instruction granularity) hash-table lookup before emulated code execution can continue.

<p>If we propose the hypothesis that each calculated jump is only likely to transfer control to one of a handful of addresses, we can avoid doing a global hash-table lookup by <i>dynamically compiling the hash table as inline code</i>, in such a way that:

<ul>
<li>The fall-through case can be used to implement a closed hash table (ie, if a table-lookup collision occurs, check the next following entry, etc.)
<li>The default case can be used to call a function which will modify the hash table to include the new, previously unknown address.
</ul>

<p>Both of these conditions can be implemented extremely efficiently in the target machine code, and should serve to speed up emulation considerably.

<p><pre>
        <em>movl</em> %eax,%ecx           # eax contains emulated system's program counter
        <em>movl</em> %eax,%edx
        <em>shrl</em> $7,%ecx
        <em>xorl</em> %ecx,%edx           # some fast, arbitrary hash function
<i>hashtable_0:</i>
        <em>andl</em> $3,%edx             # size of hash table
        <em>jmp</em> *hashbase_0(,%edx,8) # (8 is probably wrong as a multiplier)
<i>hashbase_0:</i>
        <em>cmpl</em> $0x12345678,%eax
        <em>je</em> code_at_12345678
        <em>cmpl</em> $0x23456781,%eax
        <em>je</em> code_at_23456781
        <em>jmp default_0</em>
        <em>nop</em>                      # (empty case)
        <em>cmpl</em> $0x23000000,%eax
        <em>je</em> code_at_23000000
<i>default_0:</i>
        <em>movl</em> $hashtable_0,%ecx   # rewrite the hash table to contain a new entry
        <em>lcall</em> patchup_hash_table
</pre>

<p>This is not quite a closed hash table: the fall-through method won't cause any wrap around at the end of the table. I've not figured out whether this would be a problem in practice or not. The patchup code should have the ability to extend the hashtable as necessary (probably by doubling its size) - to do this it's probably necessary (or at least desirable) to maintain some metadata along with each block containing the (emulated address, native address) tuples which the hashtable encodes, to avoid having to parse code we've already created to recover this information.

<p>The question arises of when to add new entries to each local active hash table. One solution might be to maintain the current global hash table, but do translation of code a little more 'eagerly', so each time the patchup code is called, follow through to that address and translate it as well, or the alternative would be to do some sort of global backpatching, so an ARM address is tagged with a list of local hashtables to modify when translation eventually gets to that point. The latter approach would be more in keeping with the lazy translation currently employed by the program. Then I guess the patchup code wouldn't actually do any patching up, it would just put in a request to be patched up at some later time.
