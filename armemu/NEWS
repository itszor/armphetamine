Started log. Draft proposal writtenn, instruction decoding almost working.

00:11 Oct 26 1999
=================

Problem with instruction decoding identified; the encodings of ALU opcodes and
MUL seem to overlap. Code reorganisation to tidy up and fix instruction decode
started.

14:00 Oct 29 1999
=================

Project supervision with Martin Richards - suggestion to write a proper loader
for ARM a.out binaries for testing purposes, and to form some sort of plans
for project aims and implementation strategies.

20:00 Oct 30 1999
=================

Found 'a.out' loader in Linux kernel source - might be able to steal it.

18:00 Oct 31 1999
=================

Patched parts of the old 'decode.c' into a new file, execute.c, which contains
functions to execute the different instruction types. There is now a
centralised system for dispatching instructions together with different
'action' function-pointer tables to perform some action for each function type,
eg disassembling or execution. This seems to work well, but will have a slight
time overhead. Saving and restoring the program counter, and possibly the
whole of the block-data-transfer execution function, are broken.

19:49 Oct 31 1999
=================

Changed PC to point to current instruction+8, which should rationalise reading
from and writing to it a bit.

01:45 Nov 01 1999
=================

Executed a division routine seemingly correctly - test program prints integers
from 0 to 100.

16:30 Nov 08 1999
=================

Fixed a bug in data op shift-by-immediate code

xx:xx Nov 09 1999
=================

Started using autoconf and automake to help with Makefile maintainance and
portability.

xx:xx Nov 10 1999
=================

Moved development tree to CVS.

22:30 Nov 11 1999
=================

Discovered that NetBSD swi '0' with r0=n is equivalent to swi 'n'. Feel
physically ill.
Also, problem with sysctl found.

14:52 Nov 19 1999
=================

Fixed bugs with shifting op2 in ALU instructions, and incorrect handling of
condition codes in SUB-style operands.

17:07 Nov 24 1999
=================

NetBSD system call faking is not going anywhere useful, and is therefore
judged to be a bad idea (it is wasting too much time). Work will continue on
other parts of the emulator (processor mode switching and coprocessor
instructions, interrupt support) until a better idea is had.

23:10 Nov 25 1999
=================

Supervision today: code generation using trees, ARM->register transfer language
idea.

18:17 Dec 03 1999
=================

Discovered that it is possible to use mmap() to map logical to physical memory
by using /dev/mem. Solves some of those little MMU problems :-)

14:14 Dec 10 1999
=================

mmap() probably won't work. Intermediate code translator seems to work
approximately well, working on flow analysis stuff. Some problems with
branches within blocks.

19:54 Feb 12 2000
=================

First real code has been recompiled and executed (the factorial test). No
updates to news for a while, but you may find something in the CVS comments...
