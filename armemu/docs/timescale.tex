22 October 1999 & {\bf Project proposal submission}\\
5 November 1999 & Background research and planning\\
20 November 1999 & Start made on interpreting emulator -- should be capable of decoding and executing instructions in a flat address space, in an equivalent of the ARM `user' processor mode.\\
3 December 1999 & {\em Mich\ae lmas term ends} -- test suite of ARM programs should be written, and the emulator should be extended to handle processor mode switching and `fake' system calls (eg, character read/write).\\
20 December 1999 & Support should be added for statistic gathering on emulated code\\
18 January 2000 & {\em Lent term starts} -- research done into register allocation techniques\\
25 January 2000 & A start should be made on finding ARM-equivalent streams of Intel instructions\\
4 February 2000 & {\bf Progress report submission} -- work continued from above\\
20 February 2000 & Code to generate Intel instructions at runtime should be written (this is likely to be moderately easy but very time-consuming)\\
17 March 2000 & {\em Lent term ends} -- integration work should have started\\
30 March 2000 & Integration should be done, extensive testing and debugging started\\
25 April 2000 & All programming should be done, and work on dissertation should have started\\
19 May 2000 & {\bf Dissertation submission}
