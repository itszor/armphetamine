I believe it is important to have the former working correctly before embarking on the latter. Work can be split into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}

\item Writing an interpreting emulator capable of executing simple programs in `user' mode in a flat address space
\item Writing a suite of simple test programs and ensuring they run correctly
\item Add support for switching processor modes, and fake system calls

\end{itemize}
	
The interpreting emulator should at this point be finished and
working, so work can commence on the dynamically-recompiling emulator:

\begin{itemize}

\item Add support for statistic gathering on emulated code
\item Researching register allocation techniques
\item Working out sequences of Intel instructions equivalent to each ARM instruction (will require much research)
\item Write code to `dry' test conversion of sequences of ARM instructions, outputting Intel assembler (rather than machine code)
\item Writing a system which can output streams of Intel instructions at runtime
\item Extensive testing and inevitable bug fixing

\end{itemize}

The dynamically-recompiling emulator should now be finished, so only
the dissertation will need to be written.

These sections will naturally take different lengths of time to
complete, but I will attempt to fit the sections of work outlined above into fixed-size
chunks, keeping to the following schedule (where each enumeration represents a two-week period):

\subsection*{Michaelmas term}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Background research, writing proposal document,
planning the project

\item Writing the interpreting emulator

\item Writing a test suite, adding support for switching between processor
modes and fake system calls

\item Adding support for statistic gathering on emulated code

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Lent term}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Reseaching register allocation techniques

\item Working out ARM-equivalent Intel instruction sequences, and
dry-testing them

\item Writing code to generate and call Intel instructions at runtime

\item Testing and fixing bugs

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Easter term}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Writing dissertation

\end{enumerate}

This plan leaves time during vacations in case the project falls
behind schedule. With luck, all coding should be finished by the end
of Lent term, which should leave space for revision for exams and writing the
dissertation in the Easter vacation.
