To-do list for ARMphetamine
===========================

In no particular order:

- Profiling/block gathering

- Garbage collection

- Cross-block variable lifetime optimisation pass

- MOV (load/store) peephole optimisation pass (needs variable lifetime
  to be passed down)

- Some framework for sensible testing (important!)

- Cycle counting/timer interrupt dispatch

- Implement missing instructions in recompiler (mrs, msr, swp...)

- Fix 26/32-bit subtleties

- Thumb stuff (current decoder never tested!)

- MMU stuff (testing!)

- Soak-test register allocator. A new pass might be needed to distribute
  memory-accesses, or else work done on instruction emitters to ensure
  that, eg, ALU instructions with two memory operands generate working
  code.
