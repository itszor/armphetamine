This is a recompiling ARM emulator core. It is still in development.

Very preliminary instructions!
==============================

You can build ARMphetamine into several different machine configurations:

  - lart
  - riscose
  - (others not even compilable at the moment)

You need to point APBASEDIR to the directory containing this README.

Then just go into the mach/* directory and type "make clean; make". Object
files are not seperate for the different compilation things, so make
sure you "make clean" between switching configuration!

LART - http://www.lart.tudelft.nl
=================================

This is a board produced by Technical University Delft, containing a
StrongARM SA1100, memory and support logic. This emulator is independent
of them, and does not work properly. Don't hassle them about it though. I
don't even have a LART board to compare my emulator with! Oh well.

Riscose - http://riscose.sourceforge.net
========================================

This is a project to emulate Acorn's RISC OS at a high level, in a manner
kind of similar to WINE. You need to check Riscose out from CVS, then do:

  ln -s $(ARMPHETAMINE)/mach/riscose $(RISCOSE)/src/armphetamine

Where $(..) are replaced by the right directories. Then you need to hack
"configure.in" to add the new emulator, and do:

  aclocal && autoheader && automake && autoconf
  ./configure --enable-arm=armphetamine
  make

Unfortunately at the time of writing Riscose doesn't work very well,
so you won't get much further than this. Plus, some code is missing from
the ARMphetamine side of things.
